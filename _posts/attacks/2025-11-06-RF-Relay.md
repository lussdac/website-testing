RF Relay Attack - Access Vulnerability

## TL;DR
An **RF relay attack** lets thieves unlock and start a keyless-entry vehicle by **extending the effective range** of the owner's key fob. Attackers **relay** signals between the car and the real key (often still inside a house), fooling the vehicle into thinking the key is nearby.

---

## What it is (plain terms)
A relay attack uses two devices:
- **Relay A** placed near the target car.
- **Relay B** placed near the owner’s key fob (e.g., inside a house or pocket).

Relay B picks up the key’s weak radio signal and sends it to Relay A (over a short-range link such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or a cable). Relay A rebroadcasts that signal to the car, which then behaves as if the key is present — allowing the car to unlock or start.

---

## Why it works (high level)
Many keyless systems authenticate based on **proximity** rather than a physical action. If the car receives a valid key signal, it will accept commands. The relay does **not** need to crack encryption — it simply forwards the original, legitimate signal in real time, bypassing the intended distance limitation.

---

## Typical impact
- Unauthorized unlocking of doors
- Ignition/start enabling (for vehicles that allow keyless start while key is “present”)
- Theft of vehicle and/or contents

---

## Common mitigations
- **Faraday pouch/box**: Store key fobs in RF-blocking containers at home.  
- **Turn off passive entry**: Disable passive/unattended unlock if the vehicle allows it.  
- **Key fob power-saving modes**: Use fobs with motion sensors that shut down RF when stationary.  
- **Aftermarket shields**: Add devices that block or detect relay attempts.  
- **Vehicle settings / firmware**: Enable manufacturer options (PIN to start, enhanced authentication) and install updates.  
- **Physical security**: Use steering locks or park in secure/monitored locations as an extra layer.

---

## Detection clues
- Car unlocks with no keyholder present.  
- Doors unlocked or ignition engaged with no user action.  
- Surveillance footage showing suspicious loitering near the vehicle or house.

## Legal & ethical note
Testing or using relay techniques on property you do not own or have permission to test is illegal. If you discover a vulnerability, follow responsible disclosure and notify the manufacturer or property owner.

---

## Bottom line
A relay attack exploits proximity assumptions in keyless systems by forwarding legitimate key signals. Prevention focuses on blocking or disabling the key’s RF when not in use, hardening the vehicle’s start/unlock behavior, and adding physical security layers.
