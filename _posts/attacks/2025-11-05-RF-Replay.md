RF Replay Attack — Brief Explanation

## TL;DR
An **RF replay attack** captures a legitimate radio-frequency (RF) transmission (for example, from a remote key fob or wireless sensor) and later retransmits that *same* recorded signal to impersonate the original device. It can give an attacker temporary control (e.g., unlocking a car or gate) when devices accept a repeated signal as valid.

---

## What it is (plain terms)
An RF replay attack is a type of wireless impersonation where an attacker:
1. **Listens** to a wireless transmission between a legitimate transmitter (like a key fob) and its receiver.
2. **Records** the transmitted radio signal.
3. **Replays** that recorded signal back to the receiver at a later time to reproduce the original action.

Because the receiver sees the same signal it received before, it may accept it and perform the associated function.

## Common targets / examples (high level)
- Car remote key fobs (unlock/lock, alarm)
- Garage door and gate remotes
- Simple wireless doorbells and smart locks with poor radio protocols
- Wireless sensor triggers (some alarm systems)

> Note: Modern secure systems often use countermeasures (see below); older or simpler devices are most at risk.

---

## How receivers are tricked (high level)
Some systems accept any correctly formatted RF transmission that matches an expected pattern. If the device **does not** ensure the signal is fresh or uniquely tied to a single event (e.g., by using rolling codes, timestamps, or cryptographic verification), then a previously captured message will still be accepted when replayed.

---

## Defenses & mitigations (what manufacturers and users should do)
- **Rolling codes / rolling nonces:** Each button press generates a new code that the receiver will accept only once. Replaying an old code is rejected.
- **Cryptographic authentication:** Use secure, modern crypto (challenge–response, symmetric/asymmetric auth) rather than fixed or predictable codes.
- **Time-limited tokens:** Messages include timestamps or short-lived tokens the receiver validates.
- **Signal validation and telemetry:** Verify additional metadata (message sequence numbers, device state) that makes a simple capture/replay invalid.
- **Physical precautions:** Keep remotes secure; avoid leaving them near entry points; be cautious in public places.
- **Firmware / product updates:** Manufacturers should patch insecure protocols and provide updates for devices that can be upgraded.
- **Use proven standards:** Choose products that document secure RF protocols and third-party security reviews.

---

## Detection (high level)
- Repeated unexpected activations or unlocking events.
- Logs showing duplicate command values or sequence anomalies.
- Users noticing devices activating with no button press.

---

## Legal & ethical note
Recording or replaying RF signals you do **not** own or have explicit permission to test can be illegal. If you discover a vulnerability, follow **responsible disclosure**: contact the vendor or owner and avoid exploiting the issue.

---

## Bottom line
An RF replay attack is simple in concept (record + replay) but only works against devices that do not protect against reuse of old messages. Modern safety comes from rolling codes, cryptographic challenge–response, and careful product design.
